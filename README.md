"Lock-Post" is a WordPress plugin. I created it to be able to save posts of my choice while bulk deleting. Currently I'm using it in my own websites and it works perfectly. You can use it to, just download it and upload it to your website as you would've any other plugin. 

I did it for me, I'll be updating it further on but, I'm not guaranteeing anything. It's simple code only.
How It Works:

In the WordPress editor for each post, you’ll see a “Lock Post” checkbox.
If the box is checked, the post cannot be deleted (either individually or in bulk).
